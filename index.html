    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <div class="about-me-content">
      <img src="ME.JPG" alt="Photo of the founder" class="me-photo" />
      <p>
        I‚Äôm a recent graduate of Saint Louis University with a degree in Computer Science and a lifelong resident of Park Ridge. Growing up in this community has given me a deep appreciation for its values, and I‚Äôm proud to offer trusted, local tech support to my neighbors.<br><br>
        I started Neighborhood Tech Helpers to bridge the gap between people and the technology that surrounds them. Whether it‚Äôs setting up a video doorbell, helping a grandparent use FaceTime, or fixing a Wi-Fi dead zone ‚Äî I‚Äôm here to make things work, with patience and clarity.
